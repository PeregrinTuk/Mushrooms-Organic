## General Info
This project is a testing ground created to practice my HTML, CSS and JS skills. Also, I want to learn and practice Web Design and UX/UI.

This is the website of Mushrooms Organic, a made-up company dedicated to the sale and distribution of mushrooms for food use.

## Technologies
For this project, I will use the three basic web languages:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Collaboration
If you want to collaborate with this project, you are free to make any suggestion by opening a Discussion or an Issue. ;D
